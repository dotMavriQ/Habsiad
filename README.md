## What is Habsiad?

Habsiad is an _opinionated_ productivity plugin that establishes **predefined standards** to operate efficiently while remaining as modular as possible within these confines.

Originally developed as a bridge between Obsidian and Habitica, **Habsiad is a complete productivity suite that functions regardless of whether you use Habitica** daily, often, or at all.

### Core Philosophy

Habitica handles three main productivity stacks:
- **Habits**: Things that are generally good to do as often as possible
- **Dailies**: Things you want to be penalized for not achieving every day  
- **TODOs**: Unique one-off tasks that can have subtasks

Habsiad addresses Habitica's biggest flaw: **it doesn't store your progress over time**. With Habsiad, you can import your achieved Habits & Dailies FROM Habitica INTO your Obsidian journal entries.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements
1. **Obsidian vault** with a folder called `Journal`, `journal`, or `JOURNAL` in your vault root
2. **Daily journal files** named in `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format (use [Calendar plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) for convenience)
3. **Template structure** following Habsiad standards

### For Habitica Integration (Optional)
- [Habitica account](https://habitica.com/register)
- [Habitica User ID and API Token](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/API_Options)

### Template Setup
Create a template file in `TEMPLATES/journal` with this structure:

```markdown
