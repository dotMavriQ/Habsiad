## What is Habsiad?

Habsiad is a powerful plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that integrates with the [Habitica API](https://habitica.com/apidoc/) to enhance your journaling and productivity tracking. It creates a seamless bridge between Habitica's gamified habit tracking and Obsidian's powerful knowledge management system.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Sync Habitica data to your journal entries**: Automatically import your completed Habits and Dailies directly into your journal
  
‚úÖ **Track progress over time**: Convert Habitica achievements into frontmatter data for visualization with the [Tracker plugin](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker)
  
‚úÖ **Health and activity tracking**: Built-in tabs for tracking Steps, Weight, and Calories
  
‚úÖ **Customizable keyboard shortcuts**: Configure all plugin commands to match your workflow
  
‚úÖ **Dynamic templating**: Automatically replace placeholders like {WEEKDAY} with the correct day
